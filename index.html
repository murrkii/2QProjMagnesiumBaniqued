				<h2>Unhealthy Beauty Standards: Definition</h2>
			</header>
			<section class="modal-body">
				<p>"Beauty standards are the individual qualifications one is expected to 
				meet in order to embody the 'beauty ideal' and thus, succeed in society, 
				both personally and professionally." (DeFino, Jessica. 2021). Society is 
				the primary concern. All beauty standards were developed and 
				rooted from society itself. Every country's beauty standard is different, 
				but they are all harmful just by establishing one. Some examples of beauty 
				standards include: you can't be overweight, you can't be too underweight, you
				can't have acne, cellulite, or stretch marks, and you can't be too light or 
				too dark.</p>
				<p>Patriarchy, capitalism, colonialism, and racial supremacy have all taken part in shaping 
                the Unhealthy Beauty Standards that we all know of today. (Trace back any 
                Western beauty standard, such as light skin, "normal" skin, anti-aging, 
                pouty lips, button nose, or even washing your face, and you'll find it's 
                rooted in one of these.) They're communicated to us from birth, primarily 
                through television, magazines, advertising, dress codes, and government 
                policies. Racism, colorism, classism, ableism, ageism, and sexism are all 
                reinforced by them. They serve to reinforce the gender divide.</p>

				<h2>Unhealthy Beauty Standards: Toxicity</h2>
			</header>
			<section class="modal-body">
				<p>These expectations are harmful to a person's self-esteem and might lead 
				to them making problematic judgments about their own unique self. The beauty 
				standards of society must include all people, not only those who are put on 
				a pedestal for comforming to the toxic beliefs of some people.</p>
				<p>In today's world, unrealistic beauty standards are a scourge. When people 
                look around, they see expectations of what they should look like all around them. 
                This can result in mental health problems and other problems. It can also lead 
                to people attempting to transform themselves in order to conform to society's 
                expectations.</p>
				<p>People may go to great efforts to attain the face or body they desire as a result 
				of these ideals. Plastic surgery is becoming increasingly popular. People observe 
				celebrities like Angelina Jolie and Kylie Jenner creating trends for big lips and 
				decide they want to look like them. Botox operations have climbed by 759 percent 
				since 2000, according to an Attn piece headlined "How Plastic Surgery Is Changing What 
				It Means to Be Beautiful." The problem with plastic surgery is that it runs the danger 
				of being botched, which can be harmful to a person's health. According to the Mayo Clinic's 
				summary of cosmetic surgery, there is a risk of anesthesia-related problems, infection 
				at the surgical site, fluid buildup beneath the skin, bleeding, scarring, and nerve 
				damage. If it weren't for the aesthetic standards that force women to have these 
				procedures, they wouldn't be at risk of these consequences.</p>

				<h2>Unhealthy Beauty Standards: Mental Issues</h2>
			</header>
			<section class="modal-body">
				<p>Beauty standards have been linked to anxiety and depression in studies. 
				They have the potential to cause body dysmorphia and disordered eating. Low 
				self-esteem, self-harm, and even suicide can be fueled by them. All of these 
				issues have become more prevalent in recent years, and they are all inextricably 
				linked to beauty standards.</p>
				<p>According to a NEDA report titled "Body Image and Eating Disorders," 40-60% of 
                primary school girls are concerned about their weight. This issue begins at an 
                early age and continues throughout a woman's life. Body standards that are unrealistic 
                might lead to eating disorders and mental health issues. According to the same study, 
                over half of teenage females skip meals, fast, smoke cigarettes, vomit, and take l
                axatives to lose weight. These behaviors become habits, which might lead to psychological 
                problems.</p>
				<p>Organ damage, developmental delays, and death are all possibilities, according to the 
				Eating Recovery Center's review of health hazards for these disorders. Suicide is more
				likely in those who suffer from certain disorders. What women perceive around them can 
				contribute to a negative body image, which can lead to their succumbing to these dangers. 
				The majority of girls are guilty of not enjoying what they see in the mirror. In today's 
				world, it's important to understand that different body shapes are accepted.</p>

				<h2>Unhealthy Beauty Standards: Solutions</h2>
			</header>
			<section class="modal-body">
				<p>The real solution to the problem is for people to nourish their souls and try to focus on 
				their non-physical traits instead to further improve themselves as a community. We can also 
				try focusing on individuality and avoiding social media to try and take our minds off of unrealistic 
				standards that we are pressured to accomplish just because other people have done so. </p>
				<p>Identify the history of toxic, limited beauty standards.</p>
				<p>Question beauty.</p>
				<p>Redefine what beauty can mean.</p>
				<p>Celebrate what you find.</p>
				<p>Encourage transformative definitions of beauty in your life.</p>
				<p>Encourage a broader definition of beauty with your purchases.</p>
				<p>Create.</p>
