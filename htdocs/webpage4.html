				<p>Question beauty. To be honest, what is beauty? It's not clear what it's all about. 
				It's time to accept that there are so many diverse types of beauty now that we've dealt with the toxic, 
				patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric beauty standards. Only the narrow, restrictive Western 
				notions of beauty are intrinsically bad or deadly.</p>
				<p>Redefine what beauty can mean. To be honest, what is beauty? It's not clear what it's all about. 
				It's time to accept that there are so many diverse types of beauty now that we've dealt with 
				the toxic, patriarchal underpinnings of Eurocentric beauty standards. Only the narrow, 
				restrictive Western notions of beauty are intrinsically bad or deadly. 
				Seek what makes you feel like your best self, at least when you narrowly describe it in terms of 
				"aesthetically pleasant." This isn't a fixed situation, but it's possible You never know what's 
				going to happen in the morning. Make every effort to get out of bed in the mornings and keep 
				battling. Wherever you find it, appreciate the beauty in yourself. </p>
				<p>Celebrate what you find. Outside of the narrow area of facial symmetry and paleness, actively 
				and gladly encourage other forms of attractiveness. Recognize one's richness as a human.</p>
				<p>Encourage transformative definitions of beauty in your life. Every day, from day to day. 
				It takes time and presence to remove engrained, harmful prejudices and replace them with 
				openness and empathy. It will become lighter and fuller as a result. Be aware of how your 
				beliefs about other people and how you interact with them are influenced by Eurocentric beauty standards.</p>
				<p>Encourage a broader definition of beauty with your purchases. Pay attention to the truth, 
				to the heart, and to the money. Non-normative firms and businesses that deliberately aim to 
				offer items for a varied group of people should be supported. Don't give your money to companies 
				that promote a culture of poisonous and harmful behavior. That's how we're going to get 
				there. Control the market. Within your means, to the best of your ability. Get the word out 
				if your budget doesn't allow for radical assistance.</p>
				<p>Create. Get out there and make some art. Go out and tell it like it is. Make work that redefines 
				what it means to be beautiful. Make work that defies expectations. Consider where the value lies in 
				work that is unabashedly defiant, unapologetically ugly, and unmistakably yours.</p>
