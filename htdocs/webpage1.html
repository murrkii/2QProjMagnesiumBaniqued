				<h2>In-depth Definition</h2>
			</header>
			<section class="modal-body">
				<p>Unhealthy Beauty Standards, is defined as the individual qualifications and tasks 
				(looks wise) that people around the world are expected to meet in order 
				to be seen as better people, rarely for their own benefit, and mostly 
				for the benefit of society, as it is now commonly used in the vast world 
				of professions, such as modelling, acting, etc. Unfortunately, females 
				are subjected more to this sort of predicament because of the built 
				foundation surrounding patriarchy that pull women and nonbinary people 
				down to be frowned upon. Of course, this does not mean that men and 
				people alike are not affected by these unnecessary standards, as people 
				build unhealthy opinions on various people around the world anyway, 
				regardless of their gender. These standards are mostly seen and regrettably 
				promoted in media used for entertainment, such as films, movies, shows, 
				and social media. It can also be seen in literature and writing, such as 
				story books and magazines, or even in institutional systems such as the 
				educational system and advertising. </p>
				<p>Again, what are unhealthy beauty standards, and where do they come from? Beauty standards 
				are established by society, which begins by establishing a sense of beauty by comparing 
				one human being to another, and then establishes unrealistic standards. But why is it 
				a problem? The true reason beauty standards are toxic is because they provide the 
				impression that "beautiful" individuals are better than "ugly" ones, or that some traits 
				are more appealing than others. Women are most affected by beauty standards across the 
				world (they can also affect men as well). Beauty standards are akin to an unattainable mold 
				into which you can never fit. To conform with these ideals, people use plastic and cosmetics 
				to modify or mask undesirable traits. Beauty standards are like a sickness that spreads 
				through people's minds like wildfire. </p>
